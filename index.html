    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Snowpack in urban environments presents unique challenges and significance
      due to heterogeneous surface types and complex wind patterns, impacting
      water management, hazard prediction, and infrastructure. While existing
      snowpack models like SnowModel and SNOWPACK are powerful, they often
      struggle to capture urban-specific complexities. UrbanSnow is a snowpack
      simulation model designed to simulate snow accumulation and melt in urban
      environments. This project developed a custom, modular snowpack simulation
      model within the Unity game engine. e model incorporates fundamental mass
      balance processes, including snow accumulation based on temperature and
      melting simulated via both a simple Degree-Day method and a more detailed
      Full Energy Balance approach, accounting for varied urban surface types.
      While the current model has limitations, including simplified
      parameterizations and the omission of other snow processes, it represents
      a step towards building more tailored snowpack models for complex urban
      landscapes and highlights the insights gained from custom model
      development and adaptive research.
